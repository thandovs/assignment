#CHICKEN WEIGHTS

##Null Hypothesis
* No relationship exists between chick weight and the type of feed supplement.

##Alternative Hypothesis
* The type of feed supplement given will have an effect on the chick weight.
```{r chicken_weights, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# import dataset
chickweightscsv <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")
chickweights <- tbl_df(chickweightscsv)
chickweights

# Explore data with plots
qplot(x = feed,
      y = weight,
      data = chickweights,
      geom = "boxplot",
      xlab = "Feed",
      ylab = "Weight (g)",
      main = "Chicken weights per feed supplement type")

# Comparing means of three or more groups

# State degree of freedom and p-value

"Reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis"

# Correct for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc test
pairwise.t.test(chickweights$weight, chickweights$feed,
                p.adjust.method = 'bonferroni',
                paired = FALSE)
```

#Chunk 2
#THE HOT ZONE

##Null Hypothesis 
* There is no relationship between having gatroenteritis and consuming contaminated water. 

##Alternative Hypothesis 
* Consuming contaminated water causes gastroenteritis. 

```{r the_hot_zone, echo = TRUE}


# import dataset
gastroenteritiscsv <- read.csv("gastroenteritis.csv")
gastroenteritis <- tbl_df(gastroenteritiscsv)
head(gastroenteritis)
tail(gastroenteritis)


# Cross tabulate with xtabs
gastroenteritisX <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome,
      data = gastroenteritis)
gastroenteritisX


# plot gastroenteritisX
barplot(gastroenteritisX, beside = TRUE,
        main = "Relationship between incidence of gastroenteritis and the amount of contaminated water consumed by people in a small town",
        xlab = "Gastroenteritis incidence",
        ylab = "Number of People",
        col = c("blue", "red", "orange"))

par(xpd = TRUE)
legend("topright", c("< 1 glass/day", ">4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), bty = "n", fill = c("blue", "red", "orange"))

# Statistics (Pearson's Chi-squared Test)
 Chisquared <- chisq.test(gastroenteritisX, correct = FALSE)
 Chisquared
```
##Statistical Test
* Pearson's Chi-square test
* X-squared = 74.925, degrees of freedom = 2, p value < 2.2e-16

### Test Assumptions:
* Assessing if there is  relationship between the two variables
* Running an analysis on the variables
* Data is unmatched
* Variance is equal amongst groups

##Outcome Analysis
* A significant relationship (p< 0.05) between the amount of contaminated water consumed and whether an individual had gastroenteritis was evaluated.The amount of contaminated water consumed was directly proportional to gastroenteritis cases.
* Therefore reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

#Chunk 3
#NAUSEA

##Null Hypothesis
* Administering 5HT3 receptor blocker does not relieve nausea intensity. 

##Alternative Hypothesis
* Administering 5HT3 receptor blocker decreases nausea intensity. 
```{r Nausea, echo = TRUE}
# import data set
nauseacsv <- read.csv("nausea.csv")
nausea <- tbl_df(nauseacsv)
nausea

# '40' in the data seems t be an error since te measure exceeds the pain scale.Therefore I have changed the value to be equal to '4' so that it falls within the region of the pain scale.

nausea[8,3] = 4
nausea

# plot dataset
plot(nausea$Nausea_before~nausea$Patient,
     col = "green",
     type = "o",
     ylim = c(0,6),
     ylab = "Nausea Rating",
     xlab = "Patient",
     main = "Intensity rating of nausea before and after administering 5HT receptor blocker")
lines(nausea$Nausea_after~nausea$Patient)
points(nausea$Nausea_after~nausea$Patient)
legend(4,6, c("Nausea before", "Nausea after"), fill = c("green", "black"))

# Statistical test (Wilcoxin Signed-rank test)
wilcox.test(nausea$Nausea_before, nausea$Nausea_after, paired = FALSE ,exact = FALSE)
```
## Statistical Test
* Wilcoxin signed-rank test

###Test Assumptions:
* The measurements were taken from the same sample group  
* The errors are independent
* Matchin is effective

#Outcome Analysis
* Administering 5HT3 receptor  blocker decreased the ratings of nausea intensity. Therefore, reject the null hypothesis.

#Housing Prices
##Null hypothesis 
* There is no relationship between the interest rates and median house price USD housing prices.

##Alternative hypothesis
* Interest rate affects median house price USD housing prices. 

```{r housing_prices, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Import and View dataset  
housing_prices <- read.csv("housing-prices.csv")
housing_prices

interest = housing_prices$interest_rate
house_price = housing_prices$median_house_price_USD
head(cbind(interest,house_price))

# Exploring data with a plot
plot(interest,house_price,xlab = "interest_rate",ylab = "median_house_price_USD", pch= 23 ,col="blue",main = "Interest rate effect on housing prices")
abline(lm(housing_prices$median_house_price_USD ~ housing_prices$interest_rate,data = housing_prices), col="red", lwd= 2 )


##  Linear Regression 
housing_prices.reg <- lm(median_house_price_USD~interest_rate, data=housing_prices)
summary(housing_prices.reg)

#Diagnostic plot 1
plot(x = housing_prices.reg$fitted.values,
     y = housing_prices.reg$residuals,
     main = "Homoskedasticity", 
     pch= 23 ,
     col = "blue",
     lwd= 2 )
abline(h = 0)

#Diagnostic plot 2 Gaussian residual distribution
qqnorm(housing_prices.reg$residuals)
qqline(housing_prices.reg$residuals)

#Binary outcome 
glm( housing_prices$median_house_price_USD ~ housing_prices$interest_rate,data = housing_prices)

```
## State p-value and degrees of freedom
* p=0,0194
* Df=14

## Outcome analysis
* Ran a linear regresion to check if there was a linear trend between x and y.
* A qqplot to check if the residuals were normally distributed.
* Homodeskedastic test to check if the resiuals had the same variance for all fitted values of x and y.

##Test intepretation
* The plot shows that an inverse linear reationship(p=0.02) exists between interest rate and housing prices.Therefore we can reject the null  hypothesis.
* The data is not homodskedastic which is a requirement of a linear regression and it does not fit the requirements of a gaussian residual distribution.The data didn't have an apparent linear relationship upon plotting.Therefore the data doesn't meet some of the requirements of a linear regression.
